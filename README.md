This is a personal website I've created to express myself and experiment with things I find interesting. I have decided to opensouce all the code for this website because I love seeing under the hood on things, and I hope the people that are attracted to this website feel the same way!

# About Me

I have always been interested in creating things. I find the best way to do that is through technology. I am the cofounder of a crypto implementation of Uber called [Teleport](https://teleport.xyz), a company I cofounded in 2021, and am currently the CTO of a company that moves cars for car dealerships called [Zapmoto](https://zapmoto.com)
